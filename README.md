## Project Brief
A housing rental company has hired you for a new project. They are interested in developing an application to help people estimate the money they could earn renting out their living space.

The company has provided you with a dataset that includes details about each property rented, as well as the price charged per night. They want to avoid estimating prices that are more than 25 dollars off of the actual price, as this may discourage people.

You will need to present your findings to the head of rentals, who has no technical data science background.

The data you will use for this analysis can be accessed here: "Data/rentals.csv"
